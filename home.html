                <h3 style="margin: 15px 20px 20px 170px; text-decoration: underline; padding-bottom: 30px">About Me:</h3>
                <p style="margin: -38px 50px 20px 170px">I grew up in Kodiak, Alaska and started my Computer Science journey in my senior year of high school. Out of a curiosity in programming, I enrolled in an applied engineering class in my High School and started there. This class was partnered with a program called “A World Bridge” which was also partnered with NASA Ames Research Center. During my year with the program I learned about JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and Linux operating systems while working on various real-world projects. I was studying and working on projects after school for hours on end while my teacher, Mr. Seraphim, supervised me after school and enabled my learning and growth. I was enthralled by the program, experience, and significant growth in my skills as were the directors of the program. At the end of the year, they offered me a summer intern position for NASA Ames Research Center along with another promising student. I was hired specifically to work on the NASA CitySmart WorldWise project. NASA CitySmart WorldWise was a project that detailed and showed others how an energy sustainable community could be achieved through example of our own Kodiak community. After a little more than 3 months of work we finished the project and I headed off to college.</p>
                <p style="margin: 0 50px 20px 170px">At the University of Alaska Anchorage, I started off as a biology major because I always had a plan to go into medicine. I  quickly realized my interest in Computer Science far outshined the former and changed my major accordingly. I have been studying Computer Science in school since my major change and moved to Washington to continue my studies here. I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate student at Seattle Central College and have started prepping for a transfer into the University of Washington’s Computer Science program. While studying for my degree I work as an assistant manager for a deli, and an instructor for Coding with Kids. As an instructor for Coding with Kids I teach and inspire children to code with various languages and skills that prepare them for a future in Computer Science.</p>

            <h1 style="border-bottom: solid darkblue 2px;">Monopoly (JAVA)</h1>
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Reason for Development:</h3>
            <p>This is a program I developed in a first year Java class at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The requirements for this were to make a text-based monopoly game in a Java terminal with the option to implement a GUI interface. This class did not cover JavaFX; however, I really wanted to experiment with it and chose to take the project to the next level by implementing a GUI interface independently learning and using JavaFX anyways.<br></p>
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">Project Overview:</h3>
            <img src="../photos/monopolyRules.png" width= 45% style="float:right; margin: 0 20px 20px 20px;">
            <img src="../photos/monopolyMainGameScreen.png" width = 55% style="float:right; margin: 0 20px 20px 20px;">
            <p>Since this was my first experience with JavaFX, I wanted to somewhat simplify the experience and chose to make the main game window static instead of dynamic to ensure elements did not move around or resize. The game starts at a welcoming screen and then takes you through a series of windows that lets you set rules, pick game pieces, and choose names of the players. After getting through these windows, you get to the main page and there are two buttons that give you the option of rolling your dice and ending your turn. A turn is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The player presses the “Roll Dice” button and rolls the dice.</li>
                <li>The computer automatically moves the player the amount shown on dice.</li>
                <li>Depending on the roll the following actions can occur:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The player lands on a property and has the option to buy said property (owned property are displayed at the bottom left).</li>
                        <li>The player lands on a property and must pay the owner a rental fee for landing on said property.</li>
                        <li>The player lands on a “Community Chest” square and receives a special action that is automatically performed by the computer (Example: Advance to Go)</li>
                        <li>The player lands on “Chance” square and receives a special action that is automatically performed by the computer (Example: Advance to the Nearest Railroad)</li>
                        <li>The player lands on a tax square and must pay a tax fee.</li>
                        <li>The player lands on the “Free Parking” square and receives money.</li>
                        <li>The player lands on the “Jail” square and is just visiting.</li>
                        <li>The player lands on the “Go To Jail” square and must go straight to jail and wait a certain amount of turns before being let out of jail.</li>
                        <li>If the player passes “GO” they get 200$ and if they land on “GO” they may get $400 if the bonus rule was turned on.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>If the player gets Doubles (2 dice that are the same value), they must roll again, or they cannot end their turn.</li>
                <li>The player ends their turn by pressing the “End Turn” button.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The game ends when one player runs out of money or until turn 10 (if the rule was turned on) and the person with the most money wins. This rule is turned on by default and was implemented to allow testing and evaluation of the program. Most of the common Monopoly game actions have been implemented; however, this program does not give you the ability to trade, mortgage property, or sell and buy houses and hotels for properties.</p>
